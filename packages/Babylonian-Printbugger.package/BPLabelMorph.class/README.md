A BPLabelMorph is used as a BPSwimlaneLineMorph's label and implements the following buttons:
- a button to show/hide the trace value in the corresponsing BPSwimlaneLineMorph and its sibling trace values of the same annotation in the same BPSwimlane. The interaction with the button also flashes this morph and the ones of sibling trace values
- a button to delete the trace value's originating annotation

Depending on how the BPPrintbugger is opened, a click on the morph
- navigates the browser to the depending trace value's originating method
- opens a new browser with the depending trace value's originating method
