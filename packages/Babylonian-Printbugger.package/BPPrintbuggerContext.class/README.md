A BPPrintbuggerContext is a helper class used by BPPrintbugger and BPSwimlane. It can be seen as a decoupled state extension of BPPrintbugger. 
A BPPrintbugger adds examples to or removes them from a context object which tracks selected attributes throughout them, thus creating a BPPrintbugger-wide state which swim lanes use for their layout. For example, BPPrintbuggerContext >> colorFor: having: returns which color a method should have depending on the methods found in examples' trace values to achieve consistency throughout swim lanes. 
Whenever a new example method is added or removed from, #updatedContext is sent as an update notification. On the other hand, #newTrace may be received to update the context to an updated trace (which eg. might add or remove methods important for colorFor: having:).
